err types:
    Expected errs:
        1. page not found
            1. page not found by express router err => err-handler => 404 red
                after page request
            2. page not found in the db / err in page request route => curr module handle => 404 red
        2. User interaction errs
            1. ajax interaction errs caused by user => validation err => curr module handle => json answer to curr page -display err cause
            2. after user interaction post req => curr module handle => redirect to post request source page, displau user data - err cause

    Unexpected errs        
        backend errs 
            during get page request => err-handler => redirect to err 500 page
            during ajax request => err-handler => redirect to err 500 page
            during post request => err-handler => redirect to err 500 page

if in module an expected (user interaction realted - wrong link/wrong data sent) err happens => err handled in module
if in module unexpected (wrong logic/wrong code/service is down)  err happens => err handled by err-handler

err handlers:
        404 redirect on express router call
        500 redirect on in-module unexpected err => even if ajax or form user interaction call

There are expected errors which you want to log, but since you answered it in the route you can not use next so you need to silently log it
